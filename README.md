# Synchronized-Bank-Simulator
This java program implements multiple synchronized threads that make deposit and withdraw an arbitrary amount of money from a fictitious bank account.
This is a java project that helped me understand how the Java interfaces ExecutorService and Lock work in a general sense with the creation and flow of multiple threads running the same application.
